Summary
=======

Activity for learning about while loops in python.

Objective
=========

Your friend’s been having a bit of a hard time recently, so they've been feeling down in the dumps. You’ve decided that you’re going to help them out by making a playlist of music that they can listen to to cheer up! Use a while loop to create a list of songs that you think your friend would like.

Prerequisites
=============

-   Basic usage of Python REPL

Requirements
============

-   Shell terminal or Python IDE
-   A sad friend

Desired Outcomes
================

-   Basic understanding of while loops in python
-   Usage of loops that will run an indeterminate amount of times
-   When to use while loops vs. for loops

Tasks
=====

1.   Create a file music.py, or create a new REPL in repl.it
2.   Create an empty list, and make a variable with a value of True
3.   Create a while loop that will run **while** your variable is True
4.   Ask the user for an input, store it as a variable, and use that to determine whether to exit the loop or to add a song.
5.   **if** they're done adding songs, set your variable with a value of True to False, and the loop will end
6.   ***else*** add their input to the empty list you created outside the loop

### Choto Stretch Goals
-   print out "Now playing <song name>" for each of the songs in your list.
-   put the while loop in a function so that you can call on it at will, or import it into another python program!
-   figure out a way to shuffle the list so that your friend won't have to listen to the same songs in the same order all the time.
-   make a function that will shuffle the list so that you don't have to do it manually!
-   encrypt the list of songs so that nobody will know what kind of music you and your friend like to listen to.
