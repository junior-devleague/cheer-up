Summary
=======

Activity for learning about while loops in python.

Objective
=========

Your friend’s been having a bit of a hard time recently, so they’re a bit down in the dumps. You’ve decided that you’re going to help them out by making a playlist of music that they can listen to to cheer up! Use a while loop to create a list of music that you think your friend would like.

Prerequisites
=============

-   Basic usage of Python REPL

Requirements
============

-   Shell terminal or Python IDE
-   A sad friend

Desired Outcomes
================

-   Basic understanding of while loops in python
-   Usage of loops that will run an indeterminate amount of times
-   When to use while loops vs. for loops

Tasks
=====

1.   Create a file music.py, or create a new REPL in repl.it
2.   Create an empty list, and make a variable with a value of True
3.   Create a while loop that will run **while** your variable is True
4.   Ask the user for an input, store it as a variable, and use that to determine whether to exit the loop or to add a song.
5.   **if** they're done adding songs, set your variable with a value of True to False, and the loop will end
6.   ***else*** add their input to the empty list you created outside the loop

### Choto Stretch Goal
print out "Now playing <song name>" for each of the songs in your list, with the song replacing <song name>
hint: this will require the use of an additional type of loop -- a for loop, as well as string concatenation (string a + string b) or variable interpolation (x = "string", "This is a %s" % x)
